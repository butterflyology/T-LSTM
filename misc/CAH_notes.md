### Notes for things that I (Chris Hamm) have done with the `T-LSTM` neural network started by Baytas *et al.* 2017.


**Things done**

2018-09-25:
- Created branch `Hamm_dev`
- Sent code to <kbd>Code/</kbd>
- Sent data to <kbd>Data/</kdb>
- Create a `conda` environment called `py2_ML` and saved to <kbd>misc/</kbd>
- Created a `jupyter notebook` for the `T-LSTM` script using a kernal based on the `py2_ML` environment
- Created branch `dev` from `master`. Merged `Hamm_dev` into `dev` and deleted `Hamm_dev`
- Created branch `T-LSTM-reg` to experiment with changing the softmax layer to a regression. Created `T-LSTM-reg.ipynb`.
